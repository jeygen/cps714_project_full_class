Sub-group 3 - Ticketing and Chat


IMPORTANT make sure to use react-router-dom@6.28.0

current db is dumped in lab8_db/ecofix_portal_db3.sql

see working_endpoints.txt for endpoints

currently only admin can use endpoints - need whatever group is doing login for users

when making changes to models.py need to run these to update db:

# In a separate terminal or after stopping the server
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# restart the server to ensure changes are loaded
python manage.py runserver

# kill django server
pkill -f runserver

# run server 
cd ecofix_portal/backend
nix-shell
python manage.py runserver

# run frontend 
cd ecofix_portal/frontend
nix-shell
npm start

# may need to initialize
npm init -y
